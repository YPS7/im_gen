## Problem ðŸ¤”

AI/OpenAI was one of the hottest topics in 2023. With OpenAI releasing their API for developers to experiment with, I know I had to try it out myself!

## Solution ðŸ’¡

This AI image generator utilizes OpenAI's API to generate a 1024x1024 image using DALLE 3. Using the input and select fields, users can create a prompt that also specifies illustration styles (eg, 3D render, anime, cubism, etc). The site also features conditional rendering with loading states and responsive web-design.

(PS: Each API call costs $0.04 so have fun but not too much fun!)

## Technologies Used âš™

- API
- DaisyUI
- DALLE 3
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- OpenAI
- React
- Visual Studio Code

## Challenges ðŸ’¢

At the time, I was unaware that useState was asynchronous and referred to the documentation to understand why there was a delay in changing the loading state whenever an API call was made. I also had some issues making the design responsive to my liking. Thankfully, both of these issues were resolved via documentation and trial-and-error!

## Insights ðŸ’­

I loved this project and how it turned out! I'm thankful for the team that developed DaisyUI because these components are beautifully made and easy to use. In the future, I might utilize text-to-speech via OpenAI's other functionalities.
